Short description:

The multiband compressor has been implemented successfully. However, the side chain is not applied (need more work). 
It has been combined into enhance.py. The modified enhance.py is also provided. 
Remember to put multibandCompressor.py under the correct dictionary ( same with enhance.py )
Some other scripts like evaluate_remixed are also provided. ( But now it is useless ) 

Notice:
Do not creat a band between 250 HZ and 500 HZ to prevent from overflow.
